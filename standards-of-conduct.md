## Standards of Conduct (Code of Conduct)
This is the normal and real world out-of-character code of conduct. The in-character ("IC") version can be found inside of various training documentation and in other locations. This version is considered to be the ultimate authority guiding community conduct.

### 1. Keep the community friendly for all (applies to members and guests)
- Swearing and profane language are prohibited. We are mostly adults but we don't need to talk like actual sailors.
- Further - BendroCorp members will refrain from posting content in organization communication spaces which is a.) factually inaccurate or misleading (unless it is satire), b.) might knowingly or unknowingly encourage self-harm, tangible injury or disability, c.) is intentionally bullying or harassing in nature to a specific societal group or individual person, d.) contains content which is or may be deemed “adult” content containing depictions of nudity, sexual acts or sexual content, e.) divisive political speech or rhetoric, f.) social or political activism or associated rhetoric, g.) continual non-constructive negative criticism of Star Citizen and Cloud Imperium Games, h.) any content which promotes or encourages illegal and/or unlawful activity within a given legal municipality, and any and all other behavior deemed overly negative, divisive and/or "toxic" by BendroCorp’s executive leadership and ultimately by the CEO of BendroCorp. This includes text, pictures, video and any other forms of content and verbal communication within official text and voice communication channels.
- Our goal is to keep our organization and community friendly both to members new and old and also to guests who come from a variety of different backgrounds and worldviews.

### 2. Be ready to help
- Don't talk down. Regardless of who you are in the organization, everyone should be ready to help everyone else. Every new player is as awesome as every veteran.
- BendroCorp will not at any time tolerate of any of its membership participating in activities which are intentionaly detrimental to the gameplay of others.

### 3. Keep the peace
- BendroCorp members are expected to be respectful of all supervisors and staff placed over them. Members are expected to follow all reasonable instructions given to them by a supervisor within the organization as long as those instructions pertain to activity within organizational resources or activites. 
- Any attempt by an member to sow seeds of discord between other BendroCorp members and the officers or managers of BendroCorp will result in an immediate discharge. Any employee trying to create a “coup-d'etat” against organization leadership will be subject to immediate permanent discharge.

### 4. Be Involved
- Not so much a rule as advice, be involved. Participate. Converse. Have fun!
- Specific rules and policies apply to members in terms of attendance, which are seperately addressed, but no member will ever by removed from or lose their membership because of inactivity.

### 5. No meta-gaming
- BendroCorp will immediately discharge/remove any members or guests who become members of or enter a community space operated or owned by BendroCorp for the purpose of espionage (ie "meta-gaming").

### 6. The Rules are the Rules
- By particpating in BendroCorp community spaces you agree to follow our Standards of Conduct regardless of whether or not you are a guest or formal member. Failure to follow this Standard of Conduct will result in a removal from the BendroCorp community.
- BendroCorp members agree to follow and abide by all BendroCorp policies current and future. Non-agreement to the totality of all BendroCorp policies at any point during a person's membership is grounds for the termination of said membership.
